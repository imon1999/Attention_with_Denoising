# **Self-Supervised Image Denoising with Attention Mechanism**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a **self-supervised image denoising model** using deep learning techniques.

### **Key Features**
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Uses **CBAM (Channel & Spatial Attention)** for enhanced feature extraction.
- **Partial Convolutions**: Efficiently processes images with missing or noisy regions.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: No need for clean ground-truth images.
- **Denoising Accuracy**: Enhances image quality by focusing on relevant regions.

## **Installation**
pip install -r requirements.txt
## **How to Run**
---
### **Run the Model**
Execute the script to process and denoise images:
```sh
deepself2self.py
